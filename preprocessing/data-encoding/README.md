# Data Encoding

Data encoding is computers use encoding schemes to store and retrieve meaningful information as data.

> In data encoding, all data is serialized, or converted into a string of ones and zeros, which is transmitted over a communication medium like a phone line.

How serialization is accomplished is called a _communication protocol_, and is controlled by both software and data-transmission hardware.

There are many ways used to encode _Categorical Variables_ as numbers and use them in an algorithm.
