# Categorical Variables

Categorical data refers to variables that are made up of __label values__, for example a "color" variable could have the values "red", "blue" and "green.

Most machine learning algorithms require any inputs or outputs variables to be a number, or numeric in value. This means that any categorical data must be mapped to integers.

Cateogrical variables can be divided into two categories:

* __Nomina__: No particular order

* __Ordinal__: Some ordered.
