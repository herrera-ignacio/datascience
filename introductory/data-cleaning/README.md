# Data Cleaning

Incorrect or inconsistent data leads to false conclusions. And so, how well your clean and understand the data has a high impact on the quality of the results.

> Quality data beats fancy algorithms.

## Example scenarios 

* For instance, the government may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on infrastructure and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions.

* In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information databases that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers.
