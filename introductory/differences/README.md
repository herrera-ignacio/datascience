# ML, DL and AI Differences

> Artificial Intelligence > Machine Learning > Deep Learning

## Artificial Intelligence

Science that empowers computers to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing, and visual perception. AI is a broader field that contains several subfield such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience. it is important to note that all machine learning techniques are classified as Artificial Intelligence ones. However, not all Artificial Intelligence could count as Machine Learning.

* __Supervised Learning__: Training algorithms using labeled input/output data.
    * Classification
    * Clustering
* __Unsupervised Learning__: Training algorithms with no labeled data. It attempts at discovering hidden patterns on its own.
    * Clustering
* __Reinforcement Learning__: Algorithms take actions to maximize cumulative reward.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a specialized field of Machine Learning that relies on training of __Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)__ using a __large dataset__ such as images or texts. ANNs are information processing models __inspired by the human brain__.

> The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate to each other using electrical and chemical signals and enable humans to see, feel, and make decision.

ANNs works by mathematically mimicking the human brain and connecting multiple "artificial" neurons in a multilayered fashion. The more hidden layers added to the network, the deeper the network gets.
