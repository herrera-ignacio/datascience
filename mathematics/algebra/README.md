# Algebra

Algebra (from Arabic: الجبر‎, romanized: al-jabr, lit. 'reunion of broken parts,[1] bonesetting[2]') is one of the broad areas of mathematics, together with **number theory**, **geometry** and **analysis**.

In its most general form, algebra is the __study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols__.

> It is a __unifying thread of almost all of mathematics__.

It includes everything from **elementary equation solving** to the study of **abstractions** such as **groups**, **rings**, and **fields**.

Elementary algebra differs from _arithmetic_ in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.
