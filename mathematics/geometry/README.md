# Geometry

## Overview

__Geometry__ (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures.

The scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods: differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.
