# Mathematical Analysis

__Analysis__ is the branch of mathematics dealing with __limits__ and related theories, such as __differentiation__, __integration__, __measure__, __infinite series__, and __analytic functions__.

These theories are usually studied in the context of _real_ or _complex_ numbers and functions. Analysis evolved from __calculus__, which involves the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis.

Analysis may be distinguished from __geometry__; however, it can be applied to any _space of mathemattical objects_ that has a definition of _nearness_ (a __topological space__) or specific _distances_ between objects (a __metric space__).
