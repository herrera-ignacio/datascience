# Mathematical Analysis

## Overview

__Analysis__ is the branch of mathematics dealing with __limits__ and related theories, such as __differentiation__, __integration__, __measure__, __infinite series__, and __analytic functions__.

These theories are usually studied in the context of _real_ or _complex_ numbers and functions. Analysis evolved from __calculus__, which involves the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis.

Analysis may be distinguished from __geometry__; however, it can be applied to any _space of mathemattical objects_ that has a definition of _nearness_ (a __topological space__) or specific _distances_ between objects (a __metric space__).

## Branches

* __Real Analysis__: studies the behavior of _real numbers_, _sequences_, _series_ of real numbers, and _real functions_. Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include _convergence_, _limits_, _continuity_, _smoothness_, _diferentiability_ and _integrability_.

* __Complex Analysis__:  study of _complex numbers_ and their functions.
