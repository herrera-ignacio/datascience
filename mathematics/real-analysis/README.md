# Real Analysis

In mathematics, __real analysis__ is a branch of _mathematical analysis_ that studies the behavior of __real numbers__, __sequences__, __series__ of real numbers, and __real functions__. Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include __convergence__, __limits__, __continuity__, __smoothness__, __diferentiability__ and __integrability__.

> Real analysis is distinguished from _complex analysis_, which deals with the study of _complex numbers_ and their functions.
