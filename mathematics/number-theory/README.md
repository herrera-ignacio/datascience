# Number Theory

__Number theory__ (or _arithmetic_ or _higher arithmetic_ in older usage) is a branch of __pure mathematics__ devoted primarily to the study of __integers__ and __integer-valued functions__.

> German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.".

Number theorists study __prime numbers__ as well as the properties of mathematical objects made out of integers (for example, __rational numbers__) or defined as generalizations of integers (for example, _algebraic integers_).
