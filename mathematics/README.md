# Mathematics

Mathematics (from Greek: _μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning'_) includes the study of such topics as __quantity (number theory)__, __structure (algebra)__, __space (geometry)__, and __change (analysis)__. It has no generally accepted definition.

Mathematicians seek and use _patterns_ to formulate new _conjectures_, they resolve the truth or falsity of such by _mathematical proof_. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of _abstraction_ and _logic_, mathematics developed from _counting_, _calculation_, _measurement_, and the systematic study of _shapes_ and _motions_ of physical objects.

> Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.

_Applied mathematics_ has led to entireely new mathematical disciplines, such as _statistics_ and _game theory_. Mathematicians engage in _pure mathematics_ (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.
