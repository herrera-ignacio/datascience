# Standard Deviation

In statistics, the __standard deviation__ is a measure of the amount of variation or _disperation_ of a set of values.

A low standard deviation indicates that he values tend to be close to the _mean_ (also called the _expected value_) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

The standard deviation of a random variable, sample, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its _variance_. 

## Example

For example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7. These standard deviations have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.
